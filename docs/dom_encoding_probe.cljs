;; Which shape can a Kotoba `:document` actually hold a DOM in?
;;
;; This repo is the next whole-component migration to Kotoba, and the obvious
;; move -- mirror the DOM as a nested `:document`, the way `todo-app` builds a
;; view -- does not survive contact with the bounds. This measures the three
;; candidate encodings against all three limits, so the choice is a
;; measurement rather than a preference, and so it can be re-measured when a
;; limit moves (one already did: `document-node-limit` went 256 -> 4096 on
;; 2026-09-10, osaho#88).
;;
;; The counting mirrors `kotoba.kir.value/bounded-document!`: every tagged node
;; counts one, a map charges its keys as nodes too, and the root sits at depth
;; 0 with the walk refusing above `document-depth-limit`.

;; ⚠ Count PER CASE. `cases.edn` holds many html strings, and a counter that
;; runs across the whole file accumulates unclosed tags and answers 102 instead
;; of 6. That was measured too, on 2026-09-10, by getting it wrong first.
