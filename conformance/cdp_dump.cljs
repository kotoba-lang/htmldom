(ns conformance.cdp-dump
  "Reads the conformance measurement block out of a Chromium browser that
   cannot be driven with `--dump-dom`, by driving it over the DevTools
   protocol instead.

   Why this exists: `--dump-dom` is a *headless-shell* facility, and Brave
   151 (Chromium 151) produces nothing from it — not on a 200-case page,
   not on `<p>hello</p>`, not in `--headless=old`, `--headless=new` or
   plain `--headless`, and with no error on stderr. `--screenshot` is dead
   the same way. Chrome 150 on the same machine dumps all three fine. The
   harness's browser loop treats a silent browser as unusable and falls
   through to the next candidate, so the oracle silently stopped being
   Brave — the browser this comparison is supposed to be against — and
   became Chrome, with nothing in the output saying so beyond one line.

   What still works in Brave is CDP: launched with
   `--headless=new --remote-debugging-port`, it serves `/json/version` and
   `/json/list` and answers `Runtime.evaluate` normally. So this script
   launches the browser that way, navigates to the corpus page, polls for
   the measurement block the page's own script writes, prints it wrapped in
   the same `<pre id=\"kotoba-htmldom-conformance-out\">` shape `--dump-dom` would
   have produced (so run.cljs parses one format, not two), and kills the
   browser.

   Usage: nbb conformance/cdp_dump.cljs <browser-binary> <file-path>
                                        [<out-file>]
   Writes the wrapped block to <out-file> (stdout if omitted -- see emit!,
   stdout is only safe for a human at a terminal); exits non-zero with a
   reason on stderr if the browser never produced one.

   Node's WebSocket global (Node 22+, this runs on 26) is used directly —
   no `ws` dependency, and no dependency at all beyond what nbb already
   has."

  "Delivers the block to the caller: to `out-file` when one was given,
   otherwise to stdout.

   The file is not a convenience, it is the only reliable channel to
   another process, and the harness always passes one. A 124 KB block does
   not survive a pipe here, in three distinct ways, each of which only
   appears when the reader is a process rather than a shell redirect:
   `println` loses the tail because Node buffers pipe writes and
   `process.exit` drops whatever has not flushed; a single `fs/writeSync`
   to a non-blocking pipe writes one buffer's worth and reports it
   (measured: 65536 of 124036 bytes, truncating mid-base64); and looping on
   the returned count then throws EAGAIN as soon as the pipe fills faster
   than the reader drains it. This is the same reason the `--dump-dom`
   path already redirects to a file — Chromium's stdout is unusable for a
   different reason, and pipes turn out to be unusable for this one."
