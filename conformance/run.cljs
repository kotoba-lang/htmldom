  "Differential parser conformance: htmldom.core vs a real Blink browser.

   For every case in cases.edn this parses the SAME markup twice -- once
   through `htmldom.core/parse-into-document` -> `kotoba.wasm.dom/tree`, and
   once in a real headless Chrome/Brave -- and compares the TREE SHAPE the
   two built: the flattened, document-ordered sequence of element tag names
   with their nesting depth, plus text nodes normalised for whitespace, plus
   comment nodes.

   Why tree shape and not the serialised HTML: this parser's DOM has no
   html/head/body synthesis (deliberately -- see `htmldom.core`'s L2/L3
   commentary), no comment node type, and it folds `style=\"...\"` into its
   own `:style-inline` attribute for the cascade. Serialised markup would
   score all of those at once and attribute nothing. Tag names, nesting and
   text are what both sides genuinely agree on when the parse is right --
   and it is exactly the part nothing in this repo has ever measured.

   The browser side is read the same way the sibling cssom harness reads
   layout: `--headless=old --dump-dom`, a page script that base64s its
   result into a <pre>, and no CDP client, no Playwright, no driver. The one
   structural difference from that harness is that each case is injected
   with `innerHTML` on a detached <div> rather than written into the page
   source. That is not cosmetic:

     - `innerHTML` on a <div> IS the HTML fragment parsing algorithm with a
       <div> context element -- the same insertion modes, the same foster
       parenting, the same adoption agency -- which is precisely the job
       `parse-into-document` does (it parses a fragment into a `:document`
       root, never a whole document).
     - It ISOLATES the cases from each other. Written into page source, an
       unterminated `<table>` stays in the 'in table' insertion mode across
       everything that follows it and swallows the rest of the corpus,
       including the measurement script. Half this corpus is deliberately
       malformed, so isolation is a correctness requirement, not tidiness.
     - Scripts inserted via `innerHTML` never execute, so the raw-text cases
       cannot run anything.

  "Runs INSIDE the real browser, once, over EVERY case.

   Each case's markup is handed to `innerHTML` on a DETACHED <div>, which
   runs the HTML fragment parsing algorithm with a <div> context element --
   the same thing `parse-into-document` claims to do. Detached rather than
   appended so that a case's `<style>` cannot reach another case and a
   case's `<script>` has no chance of ever being live; `innerHTML` never
   executes scripts either way.

   The result is a FLAT, document-ordered list with an explicit depth on
   every entry rather than a nested structure. Flat is what makes 'first
   divergence' reportable at all: two nested trees that differ at one point
   have to be walked in lockstep to say where, while two flat lists have an
   index. Depth carries the nesting, so nothing is lost.

   Output is base64 so arbitrary case markup can never break the <pre> it is
   read back out of, and the corpus goes IN the same way for the same
   reason -- a case containing `</script>` would otherwise end the script
   element that carries it."

  "Runs the corpus page in a real Blink browser and returns its serialised

   Two details inherited from the sibling cssom harness, both measured there
   rather than assumed, and both re-confirmed here:

   1. `--headless=old`. `--headless=new --dump-dom` prints nothing at all
      (exit 0, empty stdout) and bare `--headless` never returns. Old
      headless is deprecated upstream, so when a future Chrome drops it this
      is the first thing to re-measure -- the harness then fails loudly (no
      measurement block) instead of silently scoring zero.

   2. Output goes to a FILE, through `sh -c ... > file`, never a pipe.
      Chromium's child processes inherit stdout and keep it open after the
      parent is killed, so a pipe never reaches EOF and the reader hangs
      forever; `spawnSync`'s own `:timeout` does not help, because it kills
      the parent and then still waits on the pipe. Redirecting to a file
      removes the EOF dependency entirely, and `timeout -s KILL` bounds the
      run (headless Chromium writes its dump and then ignores SIGTERM, so
      plain `timeout` hangs -- the exit status is deliberately ignored below
      and only the file content is trusted)."

   token and never merges. Without this step `<p>a</b>b</p>` was scored as a
   tree-shape divergence -- `#text \"a\"`, `#text \"b\"` against `#text
   \"ab\"` -- when the two trees are `Node.normalize()`-identical and no

   tree shape one, and this harness measures shape.

   Applied to both sides symmetrically, and applied to the RAW text before
